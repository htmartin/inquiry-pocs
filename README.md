# inquiry-pocs

# Proposal – Plan
- Define set of inquiry-based projects for complete beginners doing self-paced learning
- projects could stand alone AND could later be inserted into pathways of data offerings (analyst, engineer, scientist)
- projects would span 30-120 minutes of learning time
- Projects may address, for example:

- How people use tech and produce data
- Mental model of pipeline for moving data
- Looking for patterns, eg in simple dataset in excel
- Ethics and data
- Question asking, problem scoping

# Design the projects
 

# Proposal – Workstreams
## 1. Define set of projects

- Brainstorm with small group of people who deeply understand experiential, project-based learning
- Define 1 to 3 projects as Proof of Concept
- Define competencies for each project - aligned to jobs, not yet fully integrated into NetAcad competency taxonomy

# Resource Allocation: external 2 SMEs at 4-6 hours each, plus internal
- 2 hrs to brainstorm – entry point experiences for self-paced
- (2 hrs to converge on set of projects)
- 2 hrs to review & offer feedback for iteration

## 2. Design the projects

- Storyboard the idea
- Write text
- Design graphics
- Create/curate videos
- Create/curate data sets needed (ideally publicly available)
- Create self-assessment and rubric
